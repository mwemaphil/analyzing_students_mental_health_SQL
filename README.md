Studying abroad can be both exciting and difficult. But what might be contributing to this? Does going to university in a different country affect your mental health? Here is a simple SQL query from a Japanese study dataset to analyze how the length of stay affects an international student on their average mental health diagnostic score. The average mental health diagnostic scores are calculated using the total score of depression (PHQ-9 test), the total score of social connectedness (SCS test) and the total score of acculturative stress (ASISS test).

The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.
